This is a small project from JavaScript Mastery@youtube. He was trying to teach the concept of sever-side action.

1. Separate sever-side rendering and client-side rendering.
    Next.js allows you to define where a component should be rendered and combine them freely. This might introduce
    some compatibility issues but give you the freedom of choosing the best way to render.

2. Framer Motion animation library.
    Animation consists of initial state, end state and transition speed. 

3. TypeScript.
    The typing system is something frontend has long for. Note there can be a mismatch for types.
